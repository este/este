# TODO: Remove clientMutationId.
# clientMutationId is FBISM which will be removed from Relay soon.
# It seems Relay needs it for all mutations.
# TODO: https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/2077

# Workflow:
#   - update model.graphql
#   - run `yarn schema-relay` in another terminal window

# TODO: Ideally, run `yarn schema-relay` after nodemon.api.json restart
# invoked by model.graphql change. PR anyone?

# non-nullable are only in arguments, inputs, and types that will never change.

# Like database/model User, but without password, webs, and directives.
type User {
  id: ID!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  email: String!
}

type AuthPayload {
  token: String!
  user: User!
}

# non-nullable in input
input CreateWebInput {
  name: String!
  clientMutationId: String
}

# nullable in payload
type CreateWebPayload {
  edge: WebEdge
}

input DeleteWebInput {
  id: ID!
  # will be removed
  clientMutationId: String
}

type DeleteWebPayload {
  id: ID
}

type Mutation {
  signup(email: String!, password: String!): AuthPayload
  signin(email: String!, password: String!): AuthPayload
  createWeb(input: CreateWebInput!): CreateWebPayload
  deleteWeb(input: DeleteWebInput!): DeleteWebPayload
}

type Query {
  me: User
  # Expose only API we need, webs of logged-in user for now.
  # Later, we can extend API for any user.
  # webs(first: Int!, ownerId: ID!): WebConnection
  webs(first: Int!): WebConnection
  web(domain: String!): Web
